How to print Different colors in the console

1. Import Colorama.
2. Then call the methods: Fore, Back and Style -- when applicable.
3. Concatenate the methods with the String you want to style.
4. Then if you want you can reset the styles back to default using the
RESET_ALL Property.


import colorama as color

print(f"{color.Fore.RED} {color.Back.yellow} String here")
print(f"{color.Back.yellow} Background Here")
print(f"{color.Style.DIM} I've been dimmed")
print(f"{Style.RESET_ALL}")

Try to wrap this in a function that can be re-used again at different points of the game.
--Add this feature towards the end after User Testing.
